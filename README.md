Advanced automatic data gathering: web scraping

If there is no package for a particular website, you need other ways to scrape data. Web scraping is the process of collecting and parsing raw data from the Web. Data may be stored in a complicated HTML marked up web page, and extracting elements from the HTML can be time consuming.

I scraped Web of Science for a literature review (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXIKzyZgya8). You would need two files for this task: (1) the search term file and (2) the Python script fo rweb scraping. The script enters the bird species into the search bar then exports the number of papers into a csv.

If you don't have Jupyter Notebook on your computer, download it from here:
